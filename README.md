# Important Notes

While this mod is active, there are four new global relics. You can disable these as well as the sprite change for Lose Strength / Lose Dexterity in the Mod config menu.

An .xlsx file containing information about each card as well as each enemy's weapon types with each action can be found within the mod's files. Please keep in mind that enemies who are not explicitly assigned a weapon type with certain actions, such as modded enemies or vanilla enemies with modded actions, will always have their weapon type set to be Neutral. If you want a particular modded enemy or modded route to be supported by The Tactician, please reach out to me.

Have fun in "Spire Emblem"!
